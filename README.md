Small lightweight web application for e-commerce build of three projects:
1) the web api (web api 2.0, ninject, signal-r, entity framework, asp net identity, auto-mapper, these are just a few) 
2) the web app (angular, angular material, bootsrap, and the usual html, css, javascript etc)
3) the tests project (selenium, speckflow, nunit, mock)

it's my first open to public project totally non profit, with one intent : to improve my skills
