Small lightweight e-commerce app

##Hi, i'm a quite new programmer, one that is trying to improve himself. 

  This is a spa web application using most of the tehnologies that i've learned so far,
  tehnologies like: 
  
    Server: ninject, asp.net mvc, api 2.0, entity framework, automapper, 
    
    Testing: nunit (specflow, selenium, mock will come)
    
    Client: angular, angular material, bootstrap, angular ui, javascript, etc. 
    
    It uses asp identity for authentication, web api 2.0 for communicating with the database.
    Client part if full angular and angular material driven. 
    
 Every comment is wellcome, no matter if it is good or not, like i said, i want to improve myself.
