Small lightweight e-commerce app

##Hi, i'm a quite new programmer, one that is trying to improve himself. 

  This is my attempt on creating a spa web application using most of the tehnologies that i've learned until now
  tehnologies like: 
    Server: ninject, asp.net mvc, api 2.0, entity framework, automapper, 
    Testing: nunit (specflow, selenium, mock will come)
    Client: angular, angular material, bootstrap, angular ui, javascript, etc. 
    
 Every comment is wellcome, no matter if it is good or not, like i said, i want to improve myself.
